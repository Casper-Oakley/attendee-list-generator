# attendee-list-generator
A little script to update our google drive with attendee details.

## Install
To install, git clone and npm install.

## Usage
If you want to use this for your own hackathon, you will need to setup google API access for sheets. Information for this can be found [here.](https://console.developers.google.com/start/api?id=sheets.googleapis.com)

You will also have to fill in some question marks in the config files. You will have to fill in google API deets in **client\_secret.json** and you will have to fill in myMLH details in **mymlh.json**. There is also an entry for the google docs sheet's ID, which you must fill in.
